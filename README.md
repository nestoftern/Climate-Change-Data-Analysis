## Overview
Climate change has certainly become one of humanity's greatest threats. It is defined as the change in global or regional patterns in climate. Advancements in technology have allowed scientists to collect various types of data regarding our changing planet, which has led to many significant discoveries.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The aim of this project is to provide data analysis of climate change in computable form (in form of Jupyter Notebooks). The main objective is to analyse the data and present it in a visual manner which is easily interpretable. We start from the raw data in form of temperatures and carbon dioxide levels (e.g. from stations, satellites, and other measurements) and provide the analysis in a notebook, so that anyone can easily rerun it and see the final results.

The primary theories we looked into and the objectives we aimed to achieve by analyzing a few selected datasets relate to the effects of global and regional increases in temperature, and its progression due to greenhouse gas emissions. More specifically:

* Analysis of average global and regional temperatures
* Analysis of carbon dioxide concentrations
* Correlation between temperatures and carbon dioxide concentrations

### Datasets: 
* [Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data/)
